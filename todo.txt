updated summary page of four step process

http://clients.manic.com.sg/offshore/member-dashboard/ - dashboard, profile and message
http://clients.manic.com.sg/offshore/solutions/international-trade/ - static page

new admin url
http://clients.manic.com.sg/offshore/b/admin



- The page heading should change from “Registration” to “Company formation order”.  Likewise, the breadcrumbs should show Home > Company formation order. (done)
 
- The URL is messy.  I would suggest www.offshorecompanysolutions.com/company-formation-order/1 and then /2, /3 and /4 for the other pages. (done)
 
- IP address detected should not be displayed here.  Presumably once the form is submitted it will be emailed through to the back office.  The IP needs to be recorded in that email. (done)
 
- “Type of company” above the drop down menu is not needed, please delete. (done)
 
- The drop down menu has two arrows instead of one.  We encountered the same problem elsewhere and fixed it. (done)
 
- I am unable to check the message for the case where no shelf companies are available.  Perhaps you could add a second type of company with no shelf companies, ie “Belize international business company”. (done)
 
- It would be better to have the list of shelf companies in a table, as per my previous email, instead of the details of each company taking up 3 lines.  There will be cases where the list will have 20 shelf companies, which would make it a very long page to scroll down.  Copying the table format here: (done)

- Please also follow the above date format and not “2010-10-10”. (done)
 
- We had this text above the New incorporation button but it has been removed: (done)
 
- I would like Offshore Company Solutions to arrange a new incorporation for me (done)
[Cyprus limited liability company] new incorporation charge: $1,000
 
- Please reinstate this, as the user needs to know that price before asking for the new incorporation.  Please avoid changing things which have already been approved.  It’s impossible for us to keep track of what has already been approved unless we make screenshots of each subsequent version of the pages.  I don’t think this is necessary. (done)
 
- Delete “Cyprus limited liability company” and “$10000.00” below the New incorporation button, as the company type is already displayed at the top. (done)
 
- Change “1st Choice” to “1st choice”, etc, just as I had in my initial instructions.  I have already asked that a universal format be applied througout the site, where we only use capital letters for the first word of a term and not for subsequent words. (done)



PAGE 2



- “Company formation order” heading, URL and IP comments as above. (done)

Do not make any changes whatsoever to content unless specifically requested.  Please make this clear to all staff. (done)

- Change “Offshore Company Solutions to provide a professional company secretary?” back to “Offshore Company Solutions to provide a company secretary?”. (done)
 
- The text within the 4 fields under Secretary name should read Name, Street, City, State and the a 4th line should be added with a drop-down list of countries. (done)
 
- Change “Annual professional secretary fee” to “Annual company secretary fee”. (done)

- Change “Upload Passport” to “Upload passport” and “Upload Utility Bill” to “Upload utility bill”, just like in my email below!  Note my previous comments re capital only for the first word!!! (done)
